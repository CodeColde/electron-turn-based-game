# Goal

Create a minigame that creates a character and completes a few puzzles in order to level up a created character.

The actual learning outcomes I hope to achieve is the ability to fletch out a side project in this format. Once the front-end pieces fit together, I plan to expand the project into something I'll add a backend to.
